      <P><STRONG>28.8/33.6</STRONG><BR>The data transmission rates of the V.34 
      protocol. 28,800 or 33,600 bits per second. Note that it is accurate to 
      refer to this speed as 28,800 bps, NOT 28,800 baud. This high rate of 
      speed is accomplished by using a higher transmission frequency than all 
      previous modems. Once the modem and software are installed and configured 
      correctly, the speed of a connection to another modem is entirely 
      dependent upon the quality of the phone lines between the two modems, 
      which can differ with every single phone call. Your effective throughput 
      of data can be increased by using data compression. With V.42 bis, an 
      effective 4 to 1 compression is possible. With these protocols, a total 
      throughput of 115,200 bps is possible between systems. <A

      converted back into digital form.<BR><A name=analogsignals></A>

      <P><STRONG>Answer Mode</STRONG><BR>The mode used by your modem when

      which the length of time between transmitted characters may vary. Because 
      characters may not be transmitted at set intervals, start/stop bits are

      <P><STRONG>Auto-dial</STRONG><BR>A process where your modem dials a call 
      for you. The dialing process is initiated by sending an ATDT (dial tone) 
      or ATDP (dial pulse) command followed by the telephone number. Auto-dial 
      is used to dial voice numbers. <BR><!-- this is for each letter ending and beginning --><BR>

      <P><STRONG>Bit Rate</STRONG><BR>Also referred to as transmission rate. The

      example, at 2400 bps, 8-bit characters with start/stop bits (for a total 
      of ten bits per character) will be transmitted at a rate of approximately 
      240 characters per second (cps). Some protocols, such as error-control 
      protocols, employ advanced techniques such as longer transmission frames 
      and data compression to increase cps.<BR><A name=classes></A>

      <P><STRONG>Cyclic Redundancy Checking (CRC)</STRONG><BR>An error-detection 
      technique consisting of a test performed on each block or frame of data by 
      both sending and receiving modems. The sending modem inserts the results 
      of its tests in each data block in the form of a CRC code. The receiving 
      modem compares its results with the received CRC code and responds with 
      either a positive or negative acknowledgment. <BR><!-- this is for each letter ending and beginning --><BR>

      V.90 standard. The first feature is V.PCM-Upstream, which allows a modem’s 
      upstream communication to reach speeds of 48,000 bps. The second feature 
      provides quicker connection times by allowing the modem to remember the 
      line conditions of a V.92 supported service provider. The third feature is 
      the Modem on Hold technology, which allows your Internet connection to be 
      suspended when there is an inbound telephone call, then return to the 
      connection when the call is completed without losing the connection. The 
      V.92 technology can only be utilized if a V.92 modem is dialing into an 
      Internet Service Provider that supports and provides a digital V.92 
      signal.<BR><!-- this is for each letter ending and beginning --><BR>
