	Hello, I am going to tell you some tips for passing your exams. There are some preparation techniques, exam-day actions and an overall mindset you could use.
	So, before the exams, don't just read your notes. Engage actively with help of flashcards, summarizing topics, etc. Also, you should try to distribute studies by days and weeks, that will help you stay toned.
	On the exam itself, read every question carefully. Check your answers twice. However, don't get stuck on a single question, because the time is limited. You can always come back to that particular question later.
	Finally, take a deep breath. A calm mind is a clear one. Be confident in the work you've done.
